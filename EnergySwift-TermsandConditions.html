      <h2>WARRANTY TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Nominal capacity is mentioned on the battery sticker and invoice.
        </li>
        <li>
          The battery capacity will degrade in time, based on multiple factors
          such as operating temperature, discharge and charging rate of the end
          use.
        </li>
        <li>
          As we cannot guarantee on cycle life of battery, we will not replace
          battery because of capacity degradation on regular usage.
        </li>
        <li>
          The battery pack which comes with general problems like bms failure,
          bms wire damaged inside battery due to vibrations from vehicle,
          connector problems & main wire problems will only be repaired. Battery
          will not be replaced for these minor issues.
        </li>
        <li>
          We will replace battery protection circuit(BMS) if it is found bad
          within warranty period for one time, if the bms fails again within the
          warranty period again. Then the cost of BMS will be collected.
        </li>
        <li>
          Mostly the BMS will not fail frequently, the issue may be incompatible
          battery pack for that specific vehicle, uncontrolled regenerative
          braking will also cause BMS failure.
        </li>
        <li>
          If a faulty component in vehicle causes the battery problem, warranty
          will be void, So we recommend the customer to do regular maintenance
          through authorised dealer and keep the vehicle in good condition.
        </li>
        <li>
          Warranty will not be provided for those who have not cleared their
          payment dues.
        </li>
        <li>
          Claim charger warranty from the manufacturer for quicker solution.
          Channelling the warranty claim of charger through us will only cause
          more time.
        </li>
        <li>
          The dealer must instruct the customer to take vehicle insurancee, so
          they can claim insurance if there's any theft or fire happen without
          any known cause.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the battery capacity falls below 80% of the initial capacity, we
          recommend to stop using the battery for electric vehicle purpose as it
          tends get more heat than new batteries.
        </li>
        <li>
          Battery is not usable once it reaches the 70% of it’s initial
          capacity. So it must be discontinued from the usage and must be
          replaced with new one.
        </li>
        <li>
          Vehicle insurance is mandatory for claiming warranty, for both slow
          speed and high speed vehicles.
        </li>
        <li>
          For non-registration vehicles, speed limit of 25kmph is the allowed
          limit by government, so we build batteries according to that 250w
          motor specification. If battery is used illegally on high power motors
          and above 25kmph speed, warranty voids.
        </li>
        <li>
          Paid service will be provided after warranty expires or on warranty
          rejection only if the battery capacity is above 80% of its initial
          capacity. Warranty void if product is used for commercial purpose.
        </li>
        <li>Do not place battery under direct Sunlight or near Heat.</li>
        <li>
          Do not use the battery for any other purpose other than mentioned
          while purchasing.
        </li>
        <li>
          Don't subject the battery to water or pressure wash the vehicle with
          battery inside.* Do not use the battery below 10°c or above 45°c.
        </li>
        <li>User must use only specified lithium battery charger.</li>
        <li>
          Charger Manufacturer will provide solution for problems in charger, we
          won't provide standby or replacement charger.
        </li>
        <li>
          Battery capacity degradation is inevitable. So capacity of the battery
          will reduce gradually based on customer usage. It cannot be claimed
          under warranty.
        </li>
        <li>
          Replacement or Repair for faulty battery is decided only by ENERGY
          SWIFT SERVICE.
        </li>
        <li>
          Paid service will be provided after warranty expires or on warranty
          rejection if the battery capacity is above 75% of its initial
          capacity.
        </li>
        <li>
          Dealers must instruct the customer about warranty terms and get
          signature for acceptance of terms and conditions.
        </li>
        <li>
          The battery must be sold to customer within three months of purchase
          otherwise the warranty will be considered from dealer purchase date.
        </li>
        <li>
          Warranty is not transferable to second owner. Reselling will void
          warranty.
        </li>
        <li>
          Battery must be tested every three to four months on dealer premises
          compulsorily, otherwise the warranty will be void.
        </li>
        <li>
          Dealer must submit service record of the vehicle to verify about
          regular checkup to claim warranty.
